# UFOs

# Overview and Purpose #
The purpose of this webpage is providing users an in-depth analysis of UFO sightings. By using the various filters, users can search criteria including date, location (city, state, and country), and shape. A combination of Javascript and HTML was employed in the creation of this site. 

# Results #

***Main Page***
As users load the page, they see pertinent information along with a description of UFO sightings. As they scroll down, a table displays information of those various sightings. Left to this table are filters to search the table.

***User Interaction***
For users to filter the table data, they will click within the desired boxes left to the table. Users can search for individual criteria such as date, city, state, country, and shape of a combination of these criteria. As users enter the information and press return/enter, the table updates the information based on the search criteria. To reset the search criteria, users will refresh the website. To help users with the correct input, text holders such as "benton" and "circle" provide examples.

# Summary #

This page design comes with one drawback which is a limitation of the data. Currently, the data is static. Updating this with a greater variety of data will enhance the user experience. Similarly, beyond the main page and the limited data available, the site is mostly static. While there is a navigation bar at the top, creating additional pages with more information will enhance the user experience. 

Two simple changes which are recommended involve the search criteria. When a user enters information, the case and spelling must match. For example, typing "Benton" will not return data. The user needs to enter "benton" to find the information. This is also limited as users may not know what they're looking for in the data. Altering the search criteria to return specific or general results will provide more usability. Similarly, adding a refresh button below the filter search form will help users know how to reset the data table.
